CNN model that detect viral pneumonia

I made this model using data from Kaggle data set  https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia (Chest X-ray images).
For training i used only normal  and viral pneumonia photos.

If you just want to use trained model you should create folder 'test_val/test_photo' and put in photo to check it.
